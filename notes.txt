leaflet limitations:
- cannot set zoom/scale exactly...only certain pre-defined levels
- Hard to customize appearance of scalebar
- No built in north arrow, must be custom added
->>>>Try rendering as a canvas: https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html#canvas

osm stuff:

- package is more complicated, importint vector seems more difficult
- <canvas> vs <svg>: Can't do as much with CSS
- compare file sizes
- have to do coordinate transformation manually (using package)
- Cheap bounds calcuation
- Text labels (can Leaflet do it? Prob but maybe not as easily) but not positioned as well
- So many imports
